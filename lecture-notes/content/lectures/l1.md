# Introduction and review {#sec:intro}
These are notes from lecture 1. 
Here is some text with math $x^2 + y^2 = x^2$, and also some display math;

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (A \otimes B)(x_j \otimes y_q) &= Ax_j \otimes By_q \\
                                   &= \left( \sum_i \alpha_{ij}x_i\right) \otimes \left( \sum_p \beta_{pq}y_q \right).
\end{aligned}
$$

Next we have a numbered equation:

$$ \sum_i \sum_p \alpha_{ij}\beta_{pq}(x_i \otimes y_p). $$ {#eq:tensor}

We have the following example:

An example with some text as well, and a reference @PortugalBasicQuantum2022 (to an article) as well as to an equation: (@eq:tensor). We can also reference a section in the following way: see section @sec:intro.
