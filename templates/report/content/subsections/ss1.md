### A subsection
A subsection with some text as well, and a reference @PortugalBasicQuantum2022 (to an article) as well as to an equation: (@eq:tensor). We can also reference a section as follows: see section @sec:intro.

Theorem thm:my-thm (Very important theorem)
:   This is an important theorem! Actually, it's Pythagoras theorem:
    $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
    Which we of course immediately recognize!

[](#thm:my-thm) can be referenced later.
